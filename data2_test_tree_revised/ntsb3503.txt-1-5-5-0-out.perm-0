While the solo student pilot of the Cessna 152 was on downwind leg for landing , the air traffic controller directed the student 's attention to a Boeing 757 aircraft that was preceding the student 's aircraft for landing on the parallel runway .
The threshold of the parallel runway is abeam and 500 feet to the right of the runway the student was to land on .
The controller then advised of a 10-knot quartering headwind from the right , issued a wake turbulence precaution , and cleared the student pilot for the landing option .
Witnesses reported that as the student pilot was on final approach , descending through approximately 100-foot altitude -LRB- agl -RRB- , the aircraft abruptly rolled inverted and crashed short of the runway threshold .
The Safety Board prepared a Study of Wake Turbulence Encounter using data from the Boeing 757 's flight data recorder , tower communication tapes , and tower reported surface winds .
The report concluded that the Cessna 152 descended into the Boeing 757 's wake when the wake was 37 to 41 seconds old .
The student 's flight instructor told the Safety Board that the student , who had 136 hours of dual instruction and 20 hours of solo flight time , had received instruction in wake turbulence avoidance at three points in ground instruction .
Furthermore , the instructor said that training as they had at the air carrier airport , most flights involved wake turbulence avoidance .
