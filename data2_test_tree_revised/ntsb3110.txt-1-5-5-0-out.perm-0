While operating in clouds at flight level 290 , in an area with thunderstorms and turbulence , the airplane experienced a loss of power in all four engines .
Information from the flight data recorder indicated that during descent from flight level 290 , an elevator oscillation occurred .
The # 1 and # 2 engines were shut down due to high turbine gas temperatures .
The # 2 engine was restarted before making an emergency landing at the Des Moines Airport .
The captain reported that the airplane had been flown into severe icing conditions .
The aircraft flight manual -LRB- AFM -RRB- prohibited flight in icing conditions above 26,000 feet -LRB- except when necessary for descent -RRB- .
Also , the AFM stipulated the minimum engine speeds which needed to be maintained while operating in icing conditions ; it also required that the thrust management system -LRB- TMS -RRB- be disconnected in icing conditions .
There were indications that the TMS was disconnected about 230 seconds after engine roll-back began .
Additionally , the AFM did not provide accurate information concerning ` in cloud ' correction factor for the outside temperature thermometer .
