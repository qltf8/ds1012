The commercial air taxi pilot-in-command -LRB- PIC -RRB- was taking a routine competency flight check from an FAA inspector .
The FAA inspector asked the PIC to perform a landing on a turf runway , and to stop short of a designated spot on the field .
The pilot made an uneventful landing , but was unable to stop the airplane prior to the designated spot .
The airplane continued to roll on the turf runway , but soon encountered a large , unseen , hole about midfield .
The nosewheel entered the hole , and the nose landing gear subsequently collapsed .
The PIC reported he had received a standard weather briefing via telephone from an FAA Flight Service Station specialist just prior to the flight , but had received no information about the hole in the middle of the runway .
A review of the Notices to Airmen -LRB- NOTAMs -RRB- disclosed an active NOTAM regarding a 24 inch deep , by 6 feet wide hole , midfield of the runway the PIC landed on .
This NOTAM was not given to the PIC during his weather briefing as required by the FAA Air Traffic Control procedures manual .
