The solo private pilot reported that while in cruise flight , about 600 feet above the ground , the engine RPM suddenly dropped to idle .
Emergency engine procedures did not restore full engine power , and he selected a forced landing area that contained trees .
The airplane sustained damage to the wings , fuselage , and empennage .
An FAA airworthiness inspector who traveled to the accident scene reported that when he inserted a probe into the muffler , he noted ` there was something loose within the muffler . '
The muffler assembly was subsequently removed from the airplane , and shipped to the NTSB investigator-in-charge .
On May 15 , the muffler assembly was cut open in the presence of the NTSB investigator-in-charge .
An internal inspection revealed extensive thermal destruction of the internal baffling material .
The baffling material that remained in the muffler measured about 4 inches by 3 inches .
By placing the remaining material in various position over the exhaust port , the NTSB investigator was unable to position it in such a way that a blockage would occur .
