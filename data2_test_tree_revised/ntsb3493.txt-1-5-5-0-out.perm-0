The pilot taxied the twin engine PA-30 -LRB- 90 gallon fuel capacity -RRB- to a self service fueling island .
There , he fueled the aircraft with 58.15 gallons of fuel at 1503 .
The aircraft was taxied back to the pilot 's hangar area .
Sometime thereafter , the pilot had used a jumper cable to connect the battery of his car to the aircraft 's electrical system at the power receptacle located on the left side of the nose .
Approximately 1732 , with both engines running , the pilot exited the aircraft to remove the chock from the nose-wheel during which the aircraft rolled forward -LRB- east -RRB- and eventually impacted a parked Cessna primarily along its leading edge of the right wing .
The PA-30 's right engine stopped upon wing contact , and the momentum carried both aircraft in a clockwise arc a short distance southeast .
The PA-30 's left engine continued running after the collision .
At a point consistent with the PA-30 's initial contact with the Cessna , a pool of blood identified the spot were the pilot was first struck by the PA-30 's left propeller .
He drug himself under the PA-30 and into a 4:30 position stopping at a point close to the nose-wheel chock which was entangled in the jumper cables .
A witness who spoke with the pilot reported that he remarked that ' I knew better , -LRB- unknown -RRB- was not removed , and the wind caught me . '
The pilot was airlifted to a major hospital and expired approximately 10 hours later .
