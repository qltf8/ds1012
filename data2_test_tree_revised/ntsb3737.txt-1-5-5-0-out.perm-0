The private pilot , who was also a mechanic with an inspection authorization , was landing the airplane from a ferry flight after the airplane had been involved in a previous accident -LRB- see ANC99LA155 -RRB- .
The pilot/mechanic said that immediately after touchdown , the nose wheel began to vibrate .
The nose gear assembly collapsed , and the engine firewall to which the temporary nose gear assembly had been attached , sustained substantial damage .
Inspection by an FAA airworthiness inspector revealed that a nose landing gear assembly from an earlier model Cessna 182 had been installed without a shimmy damper , and without provision for connection to the steering bungees .
A doubler had been installed on the previously damaged firewall to provide mounting structure for the nose gear assembly .
A review of photographs taken at the first accident site revealed that substantial damage to the left wing , left horizontal stabilizer and left elevator -LRB- including missing the outboard 4 inches of elevator , and the left elevator tip counterweight -RRB- , tail cone and empennage , and lower engine cowling existed prior to the ferry flight .
The FAA issued a ferry permit for the airplane but did not inspect the airplane , nor verify the extent of damage which existed prior to the flight occurring .
The airplane had received its last annual inspection on July 18 , 1997 , 26 months before the first accident .
