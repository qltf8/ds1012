An instrument flight instructor -LRB- CFII -RRB- and an instrument rated private pilot were on a dual purpose mission to obtain an instrument compentency check along with a business flight .
The pilots reported that they noted evidence of carburetor ice during the flight ; therefore , as they began their descent to the destination , they elected to use carburetor heat throughout the remainder of the flight .
The pilots reported that as they initiated a missed approach procedure , the airplane engine began to lose power .
They began maneuvering for an emergency landing , then the engine lost power completely .
The CFII took control of the airplane and maneuvered the airplane to avoid a treeline during the landing .
Subsequently , the airplane struck the ground in a snow covered field , while in a right wing low attitude .
Both pilots stated that they believed the loss of engine power was due to carburetor ice .
However , they were flying in conditions of snow , and 23 miles south at Zanesville , OH , the temperature and dew point were reported to be 19 and 14 degrees F , respectively .
According to icing probability charts , conditions were marginally conducive -LRB- borderline -RRB- for carburetor ice .
Postaccident engine examination and a test run revealed no evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction .
