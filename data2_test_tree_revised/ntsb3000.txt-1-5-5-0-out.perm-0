The surviving rear seat passenger/photographer -LRB- pax -RRB- stated that during a preflight briefing , the pilot indicated that they would fly by a cottage at reduced airspeed and at about 500 feet agl , then they would climb to a higher altitude for more photographs .
The pax stated that after they flew by the cottage , he did not hear an application of power to climb as expected .
The pax noted their low altitude over the mountainous/hilly terrain , and ` yelled ' for the pilot to climb to avoid trees .
The pax said the pilot did not respond , but was leaning forward as if to be trying to read or reach something .
The airplane impacted trees and fell to the ground .
Witnesses on the ground stated that an airplane flew overhead at a low altitude .
One witness stated the engine sounded as if it was sputtering ; another stated that it was noisy and loud for a small airplane .
Postaccident examination revealed no preimpact mechanical anomaly ; chordwise scrape marks were found on the propeller blades .
The temperature and dew point were 72 and 47 degrees F , respectively .
According to icing probability charts , weather conditions were conducive for the formation of carburetor ice .
The carburetor heat control was found in the ` in ' position , but the engine had become detached during impact , possibly moving the carburetor heat control as it separated from the firewall .
