Local Coherence Detection | Natural Language Understanding

• This project aims to differentiate between the original article and a disordered one with the random permutation of sentences order.
To achieve the task, Tree-RNN is used to form sentence vector and then each generated sentence vector is fitted to GRU to predict
how likely the sentences’ order is correct.
