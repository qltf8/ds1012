WELLINGTON , New Zealand -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake jolted central areas of New Zealand 's north island on Wednesday morning , but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries .
The tremor , measured at 6.4 on the Richter scale , occurred over 20 to 30 seconds at 10:52 am The Seismological Observatory in Wellington pinpointed the center of the earthquake as about 125 miles -LRB- 200 km -RRB- northwest of Wellington , near the town of Hawera , and at a depth of 135 miles -LRB- 215 km -RRB- .
There were no immediate reports of damage or injury , probably because the quake was not shallow .
The shock waves were felt from Taranaki to Hawkes Bay and south through Manawatu , Wellington , Nelson , Marlborough , the West Coast and Canterbury .
Said a telephone operator in Pamrston North , `` We 're five floors up here and we were rocking and rolling .
Just like a little dance floor . ''
Seismologist Terry Webb said the shake was the strongest New Zealand had experienced for some time .
He said it had occurred at the junction of two continental plates where movement was common .
A statement from the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences said that because of the earthquake 's depth , aftershocks that could be felt were unlikely .
It added a tremor of this size could be expected under the North Island roughly every two years .

There were no immediate reports of damage or injury , probably because the quake was not shallow .
The shock waves were felt from Taranaki to Hawkes Bay and south through Manawatu , Wellington , Nelson , Marlborough , the West Coast and Canterbury .
Said a telephone operator in Pamrston North , `` We 're five floors up here and we were rocking and rolling .
Just like a little dance floor . ''
Seismologist Terry Webb said the shake was the strongest New Zealand had experienced for some time .
He said it had occurred at the junction of two continental plates where movement was common .
A statement from the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences said that because of the earthquake 's depth , aftershocks that could be felt were unlikely .
It added a tremor of this size could be expected under the North Island roughly every two years .

TOKYO -LRB- AP -RRB- A moderately strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude reading of 5.1 rattled northern Japan early Wednesday , the Central Meteorological Agency said .
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage .
The quake struck at 6:06 am -LRB- 2106 GMT -RRB- 60 kilometers -LRB- 36 miles -RRB- beneath the Pacific Ocean near the northern tip of the main island of Honshu .
In Hachinohe and Mutsu , Aomori Prefecture -LRB- state -RRB- , about 370 kilometers -LRB- 230 miles -RRB- north of Tokyo , it was strong enough to rattle windows and cause hanging lights to swing .
About 11 hours earlier , another quake was felt on Miyake Island , about 200 kilometers -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- south of Tokyo .
That temblor had a preliminary magnitude of 4.6 and was centered only 20 kilometers under the sea .

"BC-Japan-Earthquakes | Earthquakes Continue off Seaside Resort .
TOKYO -LRB- AP -RRB- The number of earthquakes over the past week off the shores of a seaside resort just southwest of Tokyo reached 6,518 early Wednesday , with 100 of them strong enough to be felt by humans .
Seismologists believe the activity , which has caused only minor damage and no injuries , is the result of the movement of molten rock deep beneath the earth 's crust .
Monitoring of the area has been intensified , but officials of Japan 's Central Meteorological Agency say they do not believe volcanic activity is likely in the near future .
The agency said the recent surge in activity began Sept. 29 .

Seismologists believe the quakes , which have caused only minor damage and no injuries , are the result of the movement of molten rock deep beneath the earth 's crust .
Monitoring of the area has been intensified , but officials of Japan 's Central Meteorological Agency say they do not believe volcanic activity is likely in the near future .
The agency said the recent surge in activity began Sept. 29 .
An undersea volcano erupted six years ago in the same area , just off Ito City , about 100 kilometers -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- southwest of Tokyo .
Some 100 undersea volcanoes are located in the sea off Ito .

"BC-Japan-Earthquake | Villagers Begin Cleaning Up ; Quakes Continue Near Jolted Island .
TOKYO -LRB- AP -RRB- Villagers on a small island off central Japan began cleaning up Saturday after a strong earthquake the night before toppled refrigerators and stone fences and set off several landslides .
At least one car was crushed by falling rocks and roads in several places were blocked by landslides .
But police on Kozu Island , worst hit by Friday 's magnitude 5.6 quake , said there were no reports of injuries or serious damage to buildings .
Police also said reports that several college students had been buried alive were false .
Aftershocks continued through the night , however , and officials warned villagers to be cautious of another strong quake .
Kozu Island , which is frequently jolted by earthquakes , is about 180 kilometers south of Tokyo .
The island has a population of about 3,000 .
Seismologists were particularly concerned by Friday 's quake because it came amid intense seismic activity around the nearby Izu Peninsula , which has been shaken by more than 8,600 quakes over the past week .
Though the focuses of activity are separated by about 100 kilometers -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- , both Izu and Kozu Island belong to a chain of volcanic peaks that stretches out into the Pacific from Japan 's central coast .
An undersea volcano just off the coast of Ito , a city of about 75,000 on the Izu Peninsula , erupted in 1989 , sending a spectacular column of mud and debris spewing from the ocean 's surface .
Earthquake experts have attributed much of the current activity near Izu to the rising of molten rock beneath the earth 's crust , and have said another serious eruption , though unlikely , is possible .
But as of Saturday morning the quakes near Izu appeared to be subsiding , according to Japan 's Central Meteorological Agency .

The National Seismological Service said Monday 's quake had a preliminary reading of 7.5 , and the epicenter was located on the Pacific Coast between the states of Colima and Jalisco .
There were no reports of injured there or from Michoacan , Guadalajara and Puebla states , where the tremor was strongly felt .
The quake struck at 9:37 am -LRB- 1537 GMT -RRB- , lasted about two minutes and was followed by two small aftershocks .
People in Mexico City bolted from their homes and workplaces , but traffic in the capital was normal .
Trading on Mexico 's stock market came to a halt .
`` It was horrible , horrible .
I just went running down the stairwell , '' said Aurera Villa , a secretary in a high-rise office building on Reforma Avenue , the main thoroughfare .
Her nerves , she said , were shook up by the Sept. 14 quake across central Mexico that killed five people and was felt in Mexico City .
`` This gave me a tremendous scare , '' said Araceli Guerrero , a 21-year-old receptionist with bank Banorte .
`` I was a student in 1985 when the big quake hit us and I ca n't stand any kind of shaking now . ''
The `` big quake '' struck on Sept. 19 , 1985 , killing at least 6,000 people and destroyed or badly damaged thousands of buildings .
Most of the casualties were in Mexico City .
Most Mexican quakes occur along a long swath of coastline from the Guatemalan border to a point near Puerto Vallarta , where the Cocos Plate of the earth 's crust is thrusting under the North American Plate .
While Mexico City is often hundreds of miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- away from the epicenter , it is vulnerable because much of it sits atop the muddy sediments of drained lake beds .
They jiggle like jelly when the quake waves hit .",1

MEXICO CITY -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake shook Mexico City and southern Mexico on Monday , causing high-rise buildings to sway and frightened people to rush into the streets .
There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage from the second powerful quake to hit Mexico in amnth .
The National Seismological Service said Monday 's quake had a preliminary reading of 7.5 , and the epicenter was located on the Pacific Coast between the states of Colima and Jalisco .
There were no reports of injured there or from Michoacan , Guadalajara and Puebla states , where the tremor was strongly felt .
The quake struck at 9:37 am -LRB- 1537 GMT -RRB- , lasted about two minutes and was followed by two small aftershocks .
People in Mexico City bolted from their homes and workplaces , but traffic in the capital was normal .
Trading on Mexico 's stock market came to a halt .
`` It was horrible , horrible .
I just went running down the stairwell , '' said Aurera Villa , a secretary in a high-rise office building on Reforma Avenue , the main thoroughfare .
Her nerves , she said , were shook up by the Sept. 14 quake across central Mexico that killed five people and was felt in Mexico City .
`` This gave me a tremendous scare , '' said Araceli Guerrero , a 21-year-old receptionist with bank Banorte .
`` I was a student in 1985 when the big quake hit us and I ca n't stand any kind of shaking now . ''
The `` big quake '' struck on Sept. 19 , 1985 , killing at least 6,000 people and destroyed or badly damaged thousands of buildings .
Most of the casualties were in Mexico City .
Most Mexican quakes occur along a long swath of coastline from the Guatemalan border to a point near Puerto Vallarta , where the Cocos Plate of the earth 's crust is thrusting under the North American Plate .
While Mexico City is often hundreds of miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- away from the epicenter , it is vulnerable because much of it sits atop the muddy sediments of drained lake beds .
They jiggle like jelly when the quake waves hit .",1

The tremor was also strongly felt in Michoacan , Jalisco and Puebla states .
The quake struck at 9:37 am -LRB- 1537 GMT -RRB- , lasted about two minutes and was followed by two small aftershocks .
People in Mexico City bolted from their homes and workplaces , but traffic in the capital was normal .
At first , the quake 's side-to-side motion sent people swaying .
`` I thought I was getting faint , but then realized it was a quake , '' said Francisco Garrido Flores , who was selling orange juice from a street stand .
`` It makes you worry that there could me more , a series . ''
Trading on Mexico 's stock market came to a halt but resumed 40 minutes later .
`` It was horrible , horrible .
I just went running down the stairwell , '' said Aurera Villa , a secretary in a high-rise office building on Reforma Avenue , the main thoroughfare .
Her nerves , she said , were shook up by the Sept. 14 quake across central Mexico that killed five people and was felt in Mexico City .
`` This gave me a tremendous scare , '' said Araceli Guerrero , a 21-year-old receptionist with bank Banorte .
`` I was a student in 1985 when the big quake hit us and I ca n't stand any kind of shaking now . ''
The `` big quake '' struck on Sept. 19 , 1985 , killing at least 6,000 people and destroying or badly damaging thousands of buildings .
Most of the casualties were in Mexico City .
Most Mexican quakes occur along a long swath of coastline from the Guatemalan border to a point near Puerto Vallarta , where the Cocos Plate of the earth 's crust is thrusting under the North American Plate .
While Mexico City is often hundreds of miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- away from the epicenters , it is vulnerable because much of it sits atop the muddy sediments of drained lake beds .

MEXICO CITY -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake centered off the Pacific coast shook Mexico City and southern Mexico Monday , killing at least 14 people and injuring dozens in Jalisco state .
High rise buildings swayed crazily in the capital , frightening people into the streets .
Jalisco state spokeswoman Claudia Villalobos told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the 14 dead and 80 injured were reported from the two small towns of Tenamaxtlan and America , near the Pacific coast .
Both town were isolated by rockslides and collapsed bridges , and telephone and power service were out .
The Mexican National Seismological Service said Monday 's quake had a preliminary reading of 7.5 , and the epicenter was located 3 miles -LRB- 5 kilometers -RRB- off the Pacific coast between the states of Colima and Jalisco at 18.7 latitude north , 104.3 longitude west .
The quake struck at 9:37 am -LRB- 1537 GMT -RRB- , lasted about two minutes and was followed by two small aftershocks .
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured 7.6 and was felt as far away as Dallas and Oklahoma City .
It said the quake was centered 15 miles -LRB- 24 kilometers -RRB- southeast of Manzanillo , 325 miles -LRB- 525 kilometers -RRB- west of Mexico City .
Radio news reports , which could not be immediately confirmed , said the small town of Cihuatlan , about 18 miles -LRB- 29 kilometers -RRB- from Manzanillo in Colima state , may also have casualties .
But roads to the town were blocked and there was no power or telephone service .
People in Mexico City bolted from their homes and workplaces after the quake , but traffic in the capital was normal .
Power and telephone service were interrupted for about one hour on the west side of the capital , but was restored .
At first , the quake 's side-to-side motion sent people swaying .
`` I thought I was getting faint , but then realized it was a quake , '' said Francisco Garrido Flores , who was selling orange juice from a street stand .
Trading on Mexico 's stock market came to a halt but resumed 40 minutes later .
`` It was horrible , horrible .
I just went running down the stairwell , '' said Aurera Villa , a secretary in a high-rise office building on Reforma Avenue , the main thoroughfare .
Her nerves , she said , were shook up by the Sept. 14 quake across central Mexico that killed five people and was felt in Mexico City .
`` This gave me a tremendous scare , '' said Araceli Guerrero , a 21-year-old receptionist with bank Banorte .
`` I was a student in 1985 when the big quake hit us and I ca n't stand any kind of shaking now . ''
The `` big quake '' struck on Sept. 19 , 1985 , killing at least 6,000 people and destroying or badly damaging thousands of buildings .
Most of the casualties were in Mexico City .
Most Mexican quakes occur along a long swath of coastline from the Guatemalan border to a point near Puerto Vallarta , where the Cocos Plate of the earth 's crust is thrusting under the North American Plate .
While Mexico City is often hundreds of miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- away from the epicenters , it is vulnerable because much of it sits atop the muddy sediments of drained lake beds .

Radio news reports , which could not be immediately confirmed , said the small town of Cihuatlan , about 18 miles -LRB- 29 kilometers -RRB- from Manzanillo in Colima state , may also have casualties .
But roads to the town were blocked and there was no power or telephone service .
People in Mexico City bolted from their homes and workplaces after the quake , but traffic in the capital was normal .
Power and telephone service were interrupted for about one hour on the west side of the capital , but was restored .
At first , the quake 's side-to-side motion sent people swaying .
`` I thought I was getting faint , but then realized it was a quake , '' said Francisco Garrido Flores , who was selling orange juice from a street stand .
Trading on Mexico 's stock market came to a halt but resumed 40 minutes later .
`` It was horrible , horrible .
I just went running down the stairwell , '' said Aurera Villa , a secretary in a high-rise office building on Reforma Avenue , the main thoroughfare .
Her nerves , she said , were shook up by the Sept. 14 quake across central Mexico that killed five people and was felt in Mexico City .
`` This gave me a tremendous scare , '' said Araceli Guerrero , a 21-year-old receptionist with bank Banorte .
`` I was a student in 1985 when the big quake hit us and I ca n't stand any kind of shaking now . ''
The `` big quake '' struck on Sept. 19 , 1985 , killing at least 6,000 people and destroying or badly damaging thousands of buildings .
Most of the casualties were in Mexico City .
Most Mexican quakes occur along a long swath of coastline from the Guatemalan border to a point near Puerto Vallarta , where the Cocos Plate of the earth 's crust is thrusting under the North American Plate .
While Mexico City is often hundreds of miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- away from the epicenters , it is vulnerable because much of it sits atop the muddy sediments of drained lake beds .
They jiggle like jelly when quake waves hit .",1
"`` I was a student in 1985 when the big quake hit us and I ca n't stand any kind of shaking now . ''
The quake struck at 9:37 am -LRB- 1537 GMT -RRB- , lasted about two minutes and was followed by two small aftershocks .

Jalisco state spokeswoman Claudia Villalobos told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the 14 dead and 80 injured were reported from the two small towns of Tenamaxtlan and America , near the Pacific coast .
Both town were isolated by rockslides and collapsed bridges , and telephone and power service were out .
`` I thought I was getting faint , but then realized it was a quake , '' said Francisco Garrido Flores , who was selling orange juice from a street stand .
High rise buildings swayed crazily in the capital , frightening people into the streets .

MEXICO CITY -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake centered off the Pacific coast shook Mexico City and southern Mexico Monday , killing at least 14 people and injuring dozens in Jalisco state .
High rise buildings swayed crazily in the capital , frightening people into the streets .
Jalisco state spokeswoman Claudia Villalobos told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the 14 dead and 80 injured were reported from the two small towns of Tenamaxtlan and America , near the Pacific coast .
Both town were isolated by rockslides and collapsed bridges , and telephone and power service were out .
The Mexican National Seismological Service said Monday 's quake had a preliminary reading of 7.5 , and the epicenter was located 3 miles -LRB- 5 kilometers -RRB- off the Pacific coast between the states of Colima and Jalisco at 18.7 latitude north , 104.3 longitude west .
The quake struck at 9:37 am -LRB- 1537 GMT -RRB- , lasted about two minutes and was followed by two small aftershocks .
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured 7.6 and was felt as far away as Dallas and Oklahoma City .
It said the quake was centered 15 miles -LRB- 24 kilometers -RRB- southeast of Manzanillo , 325 miles -LRB- 525 kilometers -RRB- west of Mexico City .
Radio news reports , which could not be immediately confirmed , said the small town of Cihuatlan , about 18 miles -LRB- 29 kilometers -RRB- from Manzanillo in Colima state , may also have casualties .
But roads to the town were blocked and there was no power or telephone service .
People in Mexico City bolted from their homes and workplaces after the quake , but traffic in the capital was normal .
Power and telephone service were interrupted for about one hour on the west side of the capital , but was restored .
At first , the quake 's side-to-side motion sent people swaying .
`` I thought I was getting faint , but then realized it was a quake , '' said Francisco Garrido Flores , who was selling orange juice from a street stand .
Trading on Mexico 's stock market came to a halt but resumed 40 minutes later .
`` It was horrible , horrible .
I just went running down the stairwell , '' said Aurera Villa , a secretary in a high-rise office building on Reforma Avenue , the main thoroughfare .
Her nerves , she said , were shook up by the Sept. 14 quake across central Mexico that killed five people and was felt in Mexico City .
`` This gave me a tremendous scare , '' said Araceli Guerrero , a 21-year-old receptionist with bank Banorte .
`` I was a student in 1985 when the big quake hit us and I ca n't stand any kind of shaking now . ''
The `` big quake '' struck on Sept. 19 , 1985 , killing at least 6,000 people and destroying or badly damaging thousands of buildings .
Most of the casualties were in Mexico City .
Most Mexican quakes occur along a long swath of coastline from the Guatemalan border to a point near Puerto Vallarta , where the Cocos Plate of the earth 's crust is thrusting under the North American Plate .
While Mexico City is often hundreds of miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- away from the epicenters , it is vulnerable because much of it sits atop the muddy sediments of drained lake beds .

MEXICO CITY -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake centered off the Pacific coast shook Mexico City and southern Mexico Monday , killing at least 14 people and injuring dozens in Jalisco state .

"BC-Indonesia-Earthquake Quake Survivors Relive Fear as Aftershock Jolts Sumatra By MOHAMAD ASRUN Associated Press Writer .
SUNGAIPENUH , Indonesia -LRB- AP -RRB- Dispirited survivors ran amessly and wailed hysterically after a strong pre-dawn aftershock Tuesday jolted the remote Indonesian region that was devastated by an earthquake last week .
The magnitude-4 aftershock at 3 am -LRB- 2000 GMT Monday -RRB- was big enough to scare people out of their wobbly tents and other shelters , said the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency .
It was the twelfth aftershock since the area was walloped by the massive earthquake on Saturday , killing at least 100 people , injuring about 1,700 , and damaging or destroying about 10,000 homes .
Injured patients in hospitals who could not get out of their beds became hysterical , said medical chief Dr. Surya Iskander .
`` It took some time to camthem down .
The tremor shook their morale and broke their spirit , making it more difficult to treat them , '' he said .
Lt. Suhardi , head of the relief operations , said many semi-damaged houses came down crashing in a series of booms , creating more panic .
He said he was in deep sleep for the first time since arriving here and when the aftershock occurred `` I could barely open my eyes . ''
`` But the crashing noise and of people screaming and shouting made me alert , '' he said .
So far 80 bodies have been recovered from the rubble , although officials say the toll is likely to be more than 100 .
On Monday , soldiers found a 37-year-old famr pinned under the rubble , the first person to be found alive since the earthquake .
His wife and four children who escaped just before their house collapsed were present when the soldiers rescued the famr , Bachtiar .
Like many Indonesians he uses only one name .
Meanwhile , the Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Azwar Anas and Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana , head of the Indonesian Red Cross and the eldest daughter of President Suharto , surveyed the disaster and consoled the victims .
A frequent complaint has been that food and medical attention is hard to get .
Bad coordination , poor communication and torrential rains have been blamed .
In its latest relief effort , the government said it sent 20 tons of rice , 2,000 blankets , 200 boxes of instant noodles and 25 cases of medicines from Jakarta , Indonesia 's capital , Jambi , the provincial capital , and Padang , a town neighboring Sungaipenuh .
Sungaipenuh is 16 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- near the epicenter of the quake and lies near the southwestern coast of Sumatra , one of the biggest islands in the Indonesian archipelago that comprises 17,000 islands .
Sumatra is , however , more sparsely populated than neighboring Java , where 60 percent of Indonesia 's 190 million people live .",1

SUNGAIPENUH , Indonesia -LRB- AP -RRB- Dispirited survivors ran amessly and wailed hysterically after a strong pre-dawn aftershock Tuesday jolted the remote Indonesian region that was devastated by an earthquake last week .
The magnitude-4 aftershock at 3 am -LRB- 2000 GMT Monday -RRB- was big enough to scare people out of their wobbly tents and other shelters , said the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency .
It was the twelfth aftershock since the area was walloped by the massive earthquake on Saturday , killing at least 100 people , injuring about 1,700 , and damaging or destroying about 10,000 homes .
Injured patients in hospitals who could not get out of their beds became hysterical , said medical chief Dr. Surya Iskander .
`` It took some time to camthem down .
The tremor shook their morale and broke their spirit , making it more difficult to treat them , '' he said .

`` But the crashing noise and of people screaming and shouting made me alert , '' he said .
So far 80 bodies have been recovered from the rubble , although officials say the toll is likely to be more than 100 .

SUNGAIPENUH , Indonesia -LRB- AP -RRB- Dispirited survivors ran amessly and wailed hysterically after a strong pre-dawn aftershock Tuesday jolted the remote Indonesian region that was devastated by an earthquake last week .
The magnitude-4 aftershock at 3 am -LRB- 2000 GMT Monday -RRB- was big enough to scare people out of their wobbly tents and other shelters , said the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency .
It was the twelfth aftershock since the area was walloped by the massive earthquake on Saturday , killing at least 100 people , injuring about 1,700 , and damaging or destroying about 10,000 homes .
In the midst of the misery , Nurdiana Ismail , a 28-year-old famr 's wife , prematurely gave birth to twins Monday at the Sungaipenuh Public Hospital .
She was visited by President Suharto 's eldest daughter , Siti Hardiaynti Rukmana , who admired the boys and bestowed them with the names Tegar and Teguh , or `` Tough '' and `` Firm . ''
The twins and their mother are doing well and were oblivious of the aftershock that made injured inmates at the hospital hysterical , said the medical chief , Dr. Surya Iskander .
`` It took some time to camthem down .
The tremor shook their morale and broke their spirit , making it more difficult to treat them , '' he said .

He said he was in deep sleep for the first time since arriving here and when the aftershock occurred `` I could barely open my eyes . ''
`` But the crashing noise and of people screaming and shouting made me alert , '' he said .
So far 80 bodies have been recovered from the rubble , although officials say the toll is likely to be more than 100 .
On Monday , soldiers found a 37-year-old famr pinned under the rubble , the first person to be found alive since the earthquake .
His wife and four children who escaped just before their house collapsed were present when the soldiers rescued the famr , Bachtiar .
Like many Indonesians he uses only one name .
Meanwhile , the Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Azwar Anas and Rukmana , the president 's daughter and head of the Indonesian Red Cross , surveyed the disaster and consoled the victims .
A frequent complaint Rukmana heard has been that food and medical attention is hard to get .
Bad coordination , poor communication and torrential rains have been blamed .
In the latest relief effort , the government said it sent 20 tons or rice , 2,000 blankets , 200 boxes of instant noodles and 25 cases of medicines from Jakarta , Indonesia 's capital , Jambi , the provincial capital , and Padang , a town neighboring Sungaipenuh .

MEXICO CITY -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake rocked central Mexico Friday night , but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries .
The quake started at 8:41 p.m. -LRB- 0241 GMT Saturday -RRB- and was felt for about amnute .
There was no immediate reading of its magnitude , but Bruce Presgrave of the U.S. National Earthquake Information Center estimated it was `` at least '' magnitude 6 .
He said it appears to have been centered in Chiapas , Mexico 's poorest and southernmost state , which borders Guatemala .
The quake was felt throughout most of Mexico City , about 400 miles -LRB- 640 kilometers -RRB- northwest , but no major damage was seen to buildings downtown .
There was little traffic on the streets .
It was felt strongly from southern Oaxaca state on the Pacific Coast north to Xalapa , the capital of Veracruz state on the Gulf Coast .
A reporter from the privately owned Televisa network , calling from Oaxaca City , the state capital , said the Red Cross and other agencies had no immediate reports of major damage or casualties there .
It also was felt in Villa Hermosa , the capital of Tabasco state on the Gulf Coast .
The government news agency Notimex said some people rushed out in panic in the streets , but there were also no reports of injuries .
A magnitude 7.6 quake hit Mexico 's Pacific Coast on Oct. 9 , killing 51 people and causing major damage in the adjoining states of Colima and Jalisco .
In the Colima port of Manzanillo , a resort hotel collapsed .

MEXICO CITY -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake centered 60 miles -LRB- 95 kilometers -RRB- below Mexico 's southernmost and poorest state shook the southern part of the country Friday night , but there were no immediate reports of injury or serious damage .
Mexico 's second sizable quake in two weeks was centered in the southernmost state of Chiapas and felt as far away as Mexico City , about 425 miles to the north .
The tremor , with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3 , started at 8:39 p.m. -LRB- 0239 GMT -RRB- and was felt for about amnute , according to the U.S. National Earthquake Information Center in Golden , Colorado .
The quake occurred rather far below the earth 's surface , and quake experts said that mitigated its effects above .
`` From the depth of the earthquake , I would suspect that we would not get a lot of reports of damage , '' said Waverly Person , a geophysicist with the earthquake center .
`` There may be some , '' he said , `` but definitely not as much as the last one . ''
The quake was centered about 20 miles -LRB- 30 kilometers -RRB- southwest of Chiapas ' capital , Tuxtla Gutierrez , Person said .
Two houses collapsed in San Andres Larrainzar , in Chiapas , according to the government news agency Notimex , which provided no further details .

MEXICO CITY -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake centered 60 miles -LRB- 95 kilometers -RRB- below Mexico 's southernmost and poorest state shook the southern part of the country Friday night , but there were no immediate reports of injury or serious damage .
Mexico 's second sizable quake in two weeks was centered in the southernmost state of Chiapas and felt as far away as Mexico City , about 425 miles to the north .
The tremor , with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3 , started at 8:39 p.m. -LRB- 0239 GMT -RRB- and was felt for about amnute , according to the U.S. National Earthquake Information Center in Golden , Colorado .
The quake occurred rather far below the earth 's surface , and quake experts said that mitigated its effects above .
`` From the depth of the earthquake , I would suspect that we would not get a lot of reports of damage , '' said Waverly Person , a geophysicist with the earthquake center .
`` There may be some , '' he said , `` but definitely not as much as the last one . ''
The quake was centered about 20 miles -LRB- 30 kilometers -RRB- southwest of Chiapas ' capital , Tuxtla Gutierrez , Person said .
Two houses collapsed in San Andres Larrainzar , in Chiapas , according to the government news agency Notimex , which provided no further details .
The quake was felt strongly throughout the southern Pacific Coast state of Oaxaca and in Xalapa , the capital of Veracruz state on the Gulf Coast .

Notimex said some people rushed out in panic in the streets , but there also were no reports of injuries .

A reporter from the privately owned Televisa network , calling from Oaxaca City , the state capital , said the Red Cross and other agencies had no immediate reports of major damage or casualties there .
A 7.6-magnitude quake hit Mexico 's Pacific Coast on Oct. 9 , killing 51 people and causing major damage in the adjoining states of Colima and Jalisco .
In the Colima port of Manzanillo , a resort hotel collapsed .
That quake , amst exactly due east of Friday night 's , struck only 12 miles -LRB- 20 kilometers -RRB- below the surface and thus caused more damage , Person said .
A magnitude-5 quake can produce moderate damage .
Magnitude 6 can cause severe damage if it is centered in a populated area .
The past two weeks have been trying ones for Mexico .
After the first quake hit early last week , the nation 's Gulf Coast was bruised by Hurricane Roxanne , which struck later last week and meandered out to sea before returning for a second slap earlier this week .",1

Some 66 people were injured by the 6.5 magnitude quake , which toppled nearly 200 buildings in Wuding County , the epicenter , 100 kilometers -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- northwest of the provincial capital Kunming , Yunnan seismologist Ma Dianjun said .
The temblor , which struck at about 6:46 am -LRB- 2246 GMT Monday -RRB- , shook beds in Kunming and could be felt 200 kilometers -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- away in neighboring Sichuan province , seismologists said .
In Wuding , telephone lines were cut and roads blocked to a handful of towns , seismologists said .
The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that cracks were found in two reservoirs after the quake .
`` The earthquake was relatively strong and there were many aftershocks , '' said an official with the Central Seismology Bureau in Beijing , who identified himself by his surname , Ma .
Within 75 minutes of the quake , seismologists had recorded 104 aftershocks , the strongest with a preliminary magnitude of 4.9 , said Yunnan seismologist Ma Dianjun .
He warned that a second quake with amgnitude between 5 and 6 could jolt the area in the next few days .
A quake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage to populated areas .
Although the quake was unlikely to cause great damage in Kunming , people were being told to shore up badly constructed buildings or those on shaky foundations , Ma said .
Luo Shaode , a seismologist in Wuding reached by telephone , said most of the deaths and damage had occurred in two towns but that telephone links to the other two towns had not yet been restored .
Around 60 percent of the damage occurred in Fawo township , nearest to the epicenter , Xinhua reported , but seven towns had yet to report their conditions .
Provincial officials sent 30 teams to help out with relief and damage assessment , Ma Dianjun said .
The area , about 2,200 kilometers -LRB- 1,300 miles -RRB- southwest of Beijing , has steep mountains rising to more than 2,000 meters -LRB- 6,500 feet -RRB- and is not heavily populated .",1

BEIJING -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake with numerous aftershocks knocked over buildings and killed at least 29 people in southwestern China 's mountainous Yunnan province Tuesday , Chinese seismology officials and state-run media said .
Some 72 people were injured by the 6.5 magnitude quake , which toppled nearly 200 buildings in Wuding County , the epicenter , 100 kilometers -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- northwest of the provincial capital Kunming , the state-run Xinhua News Agency said .
The temblor , which struck at about 6:46 am -LRB- 2246 GMT Monday -RRB- , shook beds in Kunming and could be felt 200 kilometers -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- away in neighboring Sichuan province , seismologists said .
In Wuding , telephone lines were cut and roads blocked to a handful of towns , seismologists said .
Xinhua reported that cracks were found in two reservoirs after the quake .
`` The earthquake was relatively strong and there were many aftershocks , '' said an official with the Central Seismology Bureau in Beijing , who identified himself by his surname , Ma .
Within 75 minutes of the quake , seismologists had recorded 104 aftershocks , the strongest with a preliminary magnitude of 4.9 , said Yunnan seismologist Ma Dianjun in Kunming .
He warned that a second quake with amgnitude between 5 and 6 could jolt the area in the next few days .
A quake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage to populated areas .
Although the quake was unlikely to cause great damage in Kunming , people were being told to shore up badly constructed buildings or those on shaky foundations , Ma said .
Most of the deaths occurred in Wuding and neighboring Luquan County , Ma said .
One person died and three were injured in Panzhihua , a steel town 100 kilometers -LRB- 63 miles -RRB- north in Sichuan , Xinhua said .
Luo Shaode , a seismologist in Wuding reached by telephone , said most of the deaths and damage had occurred in two towns but that telephone links to the other two towns had not yet been restored .
Around 60 percent of the damage occurred in Fawo township , nearest to the epicenter , Xinhua reported , but seven towns had yet to report their conditions .
Provincial officials sent 30 teams to help out with relief and damage assessment , Ma Dianjun said .
The area , about 2,200 kilometers -LRB- 1,300 miles -RRB- southwest of Beijing , has steep mountains rising to more than 2,000 meters -LRB- 6,500 feet -RRB- and is not heavily populated .",1

In Wuding , telephone lines were cut and roads blocked to a handful of towns , seismologists said .
Xinhua reported that cracks were found in two reservoirs after the quake .
`` The earthquake was relatively strong and there were many aftershocks , '' said an official with the Central Seismology Bureau in Beijing , who identified himself by his surname , Ma .
Within 75 minutes of the quake , seismologists had recorded 104 aftershocks , the strongest with a preliminary magnitude of 4.9 , said Yunnan seismologist Ma Dianjun in Kunming .
He warned that a second quake with amgnitude between 5 and 6 could jolt the area in the next few days .
A quake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage to populated areas .
Although the quake was unlikely to cause great damage in Kunming , people were being told to shore up badly constructed buildings or those on shaky foundations , Ma said .
Most of the deaths occurred in Wuding and neighboring Luquan County , Ma said .
One person died and three were injured in Panzhihua , a steel town 100 kilometers -LRB- 63 miles -RRB- north in Sichuan , Xinhua said .
Luo Shaode , a seismologist in Wuding reached by telephone , said most of the deaths and damage had occurred in two towns but that telephone links to the other two towns had not yet been restored .
Around 60 percent of the damage occurred in Fawo township , nearest to the epicenter , Xinhua reported , but seven towns had yet to report their conditions .
Provincial officials sent 30 teams to help out with relief and damage assessment , Ma Dianjun said .
The area , about 2,200 kilometers -LRB- 1,300 miles -RRB- southwest of Beijing , has steep mountains rising to more than 2,000 meters -LRB- 6,500 feet -RRB- and is not heavily populated .",1

He warned that a second quake with amgnitude between 5 and 6 could jolt the area in the next few days .
A quake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage to populated areas .
Although the quake was unlikely to cause great damage in Kunming , people were being told to shore up badly constructed buildings or those on shaky foundations , Ma said .
Most of the deaths occurred in Wuding and neighboring Luquan County , Ma said .
One person died and three were injured in Panzhihua , a steel town 100 kilometers -LRB- 63 miles -RRB- north in Sichuan , Xinhua said .
Luo Shaode , a seismologist in Wuding reached by telephone , said most of the deaths and damage had occurred in two towns but that telephone links to the other two towns had not yet been restored .
Around 60 percent of the damage occurred in Fawo township , nearest to the epicenter , Xinhua reported , but seven towns had yet to report their conditions .
Provincial officials sent 30 teams to help out with relief and damage assessment , Ma Dianjun said .
The area , about 2,200 kilometers -LRB- 1,300 miles -RRB- southwest of Beijing , has steep mountains rising to more than 2,000 meters -LRB- 6,500 feet -RRB- and is not heavily populated .",1

JAKARTA , Indonesia -LRB- AP -RRB- Two strong earthquakes rocked Indonesia 's Sumatra Island Wednesday , but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties , the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency and news reports said .
The first quake , with amgnitude of 6.1 , jolted Banda Aceh and surrounding areas on the northern tip of the island , and many people raced out into the streets in fear , the official Antara news agency said .
Banda Aceh , about 1,700 kilometers -LRB- 1,062 miles -RRB- northwest of Jakarta , is the capital of Aceh province .
It said the local Meteorology and Geophysics Agency located the quake 's epicenter under the Indian Ocean , about 450 kilometers -LRB- 281 miles -RRB- south of Banda Aceh .
Twenty minutes later , at 2:34 p.m. -LRB- 0734 GMT -RRB- , a quake of magnitude 6.5 hit the island , said Harit Heru , an officer of the agency 's Jakarta headquarters .
This one also was centered under the Indian Ocean , about 170 kilometers -LRB- 106 miles -RRB- southwest of Gunungsitoli , he said .
Gunungsitoli is on an island off the western coast of North Sumatra .
It is about 1,250 kilometers -LRB- 781 miles -RRB- northwest of Jakarta .
Tremors of the first quake Wednesday were felt in many parts of Aceh and the province 's islands off the western coast , Antara said .
The second 's tremors were felt from the North Sumatra capital of Medan to Panjang , a port town in southern Sumatra .
A quake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3 had rocked southwestern Sumatra on Sunday without causing any casualties .
But last month , amgnitude-7 quake killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands of building in the Sumatran province of Jambi .
A magnitude-6 quake is capable of causing severe damage around the epicenter .",1
