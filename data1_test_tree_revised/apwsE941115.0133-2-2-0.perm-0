CALAPAN , Philippines -LRB- AP -RRB- Hundreds of people who survived a typhoon in their seaside villages last month gave up and fled the area Tuesday after a strong earthquake and a tidal wave destroyed everything they had left on their central Philippine island .
Carrying bags of food and clothing on their heads and shoulders , at least 450 people walked down tar roads with huge cracks left in them by the quake that struck before dawn .
At least 45 people were killed on the northern coast of Mindoro Island , 135 injured and eight left missing , and as many as 200 homes were destroyed , said Rodolfo Valencia , one of its two governors .
Most of the deaths came in the 3-foot -LRB- one-meter -RRB- - tall tidal wave .
Yuji Murata , 41 , a scientist studying orchids for the Japanese government , was trapped by landslides along with three Filipino guides on a 5,000-foot -LRB- 1,525-meter -RRB- mountain , local people said .
The quake struck the island 's Oriental Mindaro province the day it planned to celebrate the 44th anniversary of its founding , and people planning a parade spent the day helping survivors .
When the quake struck at 3:15 am , it was felt throughout the central and southern Philippines and rocked skyscrapers and tall hotels in Manila , 75 miles -LRB- 120 kilometers -RRB- north of the epicenter .
But no damage or injuries were reported very far outside the quake zone .
Throughout the day , several of the 888 aftershocks jarred Mindoro Island again , startling many residents .
`` We are afraid of the sea , '' said Francisca Pascua , 48 , as she walked toward two shelters that were quickly set up in a high school gym and on a hilly field near a hospital in the town of Calapan .
She was with her four daughters and two grandchildren .
Many other shellshocked people also fled Malaylay , the hardest hit village , where at least 25 people died .
For Purina Rosales , the nightmare began there when the quake leveled her bamboo home and the tidal wave struck .
A few hours later , she found the bodies of Eduardo , her husband , and Alesa , her 4-year-old daughter , a long way away .
`` I need you !
I need you ! ''
Mrs. Rosales screamed as she knelt in a one-room schoolhouse where they and 13 other bodies had been placed on benches .
`` Why did n't you use your strength and swim ? ''
she cried to her husband .
Like other survivors in the village of huts and dirt roads , Mrs. Rosales said she grabbed one of the area 's many coconut trees when she was swept away by the tidal wave .
In Malaylay and other fishing villages , several typhoons , including the strongest one last month , had kept many fishermen at home , but none of their homes was destroyed .
That all changed Tuesday with the quake and tidal wave .
President Fidel Ramos , who was at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Indonesia , sent dlrs 208,000 to help rebuild the homes .
Military helicopters also were rushing in food , drinking water and medical supplies .
The earthquake cut off electricity to most of Mindoro Island and destroyed many of its water mains , said Valencia .
The quake had amgnitude of 7.1 and was centered in a strait six miles -LRB- 10 kilometers -RRB- north of the island .
Ted Sandoval , a Filipino seismologist , said the temblor was one of the strongest ever to occur on the active Lubang fault .
A magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage if centered under a populated area , while magnitude 7 indicates amjor quake capable of widespread , heavy damage .
The Philippines , a Pacific archipelago of 7,100 mountainous islands , sits on at least four major faults .
An earthquake in 1990 killed nearly 2,000 people on the main island of Luzon .
