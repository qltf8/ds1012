JAKARTA , Indonesia -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.7 rocked Indonesia 's easternmost province of Irian Jaya , but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties , an official said Wednesday .
The quake struck the district of Nabire , 3,130 kilometers -LRB- 1,950 miles -RRB- northeast of Jakarta , at 11:35 p.m. Tuesday -LRB- 1435 GMT -RRB- when most people were asleep , said Suhardjono of the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency .
Its epicenter was about 25 kilometers -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- southwest of Nabire in a densely forested area , said Suhardjono , who like many Indonesians uses only one name .
The quake was also felt as far away as Timika , about 200 kilometers -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- southeast of Nabire , said a district official contacted by telephone .
An earthquake of magnitude 5 is capable of causing considerable damage .
The magnitude measures the total energy released by an earthquake , as indicated by ground motion recorded on seismographs .
An increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold increase in the strength of the quake .
In the most devastating earthquake in Indonesia in recent times , a tremor with a 7.5 magnitude killed at least 2,500 people and destroyed thousands of buildings on Flores Island in December 1992 .
