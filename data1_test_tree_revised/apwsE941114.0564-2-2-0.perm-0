MALAYLAY , Philippines -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake rocked the Philippine island of Mindoro early Tuesday , killing at least 23 people many as they slept and destroying nearly 200 homes .
In Malaylay , a small fishing village on the northern coast of the island , at least 23 people died , eight were missing , and 32 homes were destroyed , officials and police said .
Injured people sitting and crying in the rubble of their homes said that moments after the quake struck a wall of water washed through their devastated village on the mouth of a river .
DZRH and DZMM radio reported that at least 31 people died on the island , many while sleeping in buildings that collapsed , including a Philippine Coast Guard structure .
Both stations quoted Rodolfo Valencia , one of the island 's two governors .
Lourdes Masing , the disaster-service director of the National Red Cross in Manila , said at least six people died , 31 were injured , one was missing , and 188 homes were heavily damaged .
Mindoro Island is still recovering from a typhoon that struck the area last month , destroying much of the coconut and rice that famrs grow in small fields there .
President Fidel Ramos , who is at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Indonesia , ordered 5 million pesos -LRB- dlrs 208,000 -RRB- sent to the islands to help rebuild destroyed homes .
Food and medical supplies were being rushed to the island on four military helicopters .
The quake , which occurred at 3:15 am -LRB- 14:15 Monday GMT -RRB- , had a preliminary magnitude of 7 and was centered in a strait 10 kilometers -LRB- six miles -RRB- north of Calapan , a town on the northern end of the island , said the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology .
Calapan is less than 5 kilometers -LRB- 3 miles -RRB- east of Malaylay .
Lasting about four minutes , the quake was felt at intensities of 3 and 4 throughout central and south Philippines , including Manila , 75 miles -LRB- 120 kilometers -RRB- north of the epicenter , said Ted Sandoval , a specialist at the institute .
The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park , Calif. , and the Royal Hong Kong Observatory both put the quake 's preliminary magnitude at 7.1 .
No damage was immediately reported in Manila , where people in large hotels woke up as they shook , or in other areas outside Mindoro Island , a police spokesman in Manila said .
Gov. Valencia told radio stations that some homes were washed away by large waves , and three bridges were damaged and closed .
But Sandoval said no tidal waves were reported or expected from the quake , one of the strongest ever to occur on the Lubang fault , one of the area 's most active .
A magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage if centered under a populated area , while amgnitude 7 quake indicates a major quake capable of widespread , heavy damage .
The Philippines , a Pacific archipelago of 7,100 mountainous islands , sits on at least four major faults .
An earthquake in 1990 killed nearly 2,000 people on the main island of Luzon .
