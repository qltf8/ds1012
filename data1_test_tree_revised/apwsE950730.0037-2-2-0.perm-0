WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- A powerful earthquake followed by two strong aftershocks hit northeastern Chile early Sunday near the city of Antofagasta , the U.S. Geological Survey reported .
The earthquake , which had a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 , happened about 1:11 am EDT -LRB- 0511 GMT -RRB- about 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- northeast of Antofagasta , a city of about a quarter million people some 1,126.5 kilometers -LRB- 700 miles -RRB- from the national capital Santiago , said Rebecca Phipps , a spokeswoman for the geological survey .
There were no immediate reports on damage or injuries , she said .
The earthquake was followed by a preliminary magnitude 6 aftershock at 1:25 am -LRB- 0525 GMT -RRB- and a preliminary magnitude 6.1 aftershock at 1:47 a.m. -LRB- 0547 GMT -RRB- , the geological survey said .
The magnitude is related to the size of the earthquake fault and the amount the ground slips , as determined by analysis of seismic waves .
The magnitude values differ slightly from those of the Richter scale , which is no longer widely used by seismologists .
The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , for example , registered an estimated 8.3 on the Richter scale .
Its moment magnitude has been estimated at 7.9 .
An earthquake with amgnitude between 6 and 7 can cause severe damage .
